# Generative Computer

![Generative Computer desktop](./screenshot.png)

Generative Computer is an interactive desktop inspired by Claude Imagine and built on top of Gemini CLI. You can talk to the computer to generate any content you want.

This is a proof of concept which will be iterated quickly as the project develops.

## How It Works

1. You type a request in the computer (rendered in the browser).
2. The backend forwards the request—and strict guardrails—to the Gemini CLI bundle.
3. Gemini edits `GeneratedContent.tsx` (and only that file).
4. Vite hot-reloads, so the desktop windows morph in real time.

## System Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm 9+
- Gemini CLI credentials on the machine (OAuth login, API key, or Vertex AI)

## First-Time Setup

Do this once on a fresh clone:

```bash
npm install          # install repo + CLI dependencies
npm run build        # create bundle/gemini.js used by the agent
npm start            # launch Gemini CLI to authenticate (Login with Google, etc.)
```

After `npm start` completes and you exit the CLI, your credentials are cached under `~/.gemini/` and the start script can reuse them.

## Run the Full Experience

```bash
./start.sh
```

The orchestrator will:

- Double-check Gemini authentication (and reopen `npm start` if credentials are missing)
- Install dependencies for the repo, backend, and frontend when `node_modules/` folders are absent
- Build the Gemini CLI bundle if `bundle/gemini.js` is missing
- Start the backend on `http://localhost:3001` with `USE_REAL_AGENT=true`
- Start the Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173`

Press `Ctrl+C` to shut everything down.

### Helpful Environment Flags

- `DEBUG_AGENT=true ./start.sh` — surface Gemini stdout/stderr and write transcripts to `logs/agent/`

```

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing bundle** – run `npm run build` if `bundle/gemini.js` is absent before calling `npm start` or `./start.sh`.
- **Authentication loop** – rerun `npm start` and choose “Login with Google” (or your preferred auth mode) to refresh credentials.
- **Ports 3001/5173 busy** – stop conflicting processes; `./start.sh` attempts to free both ports automatically.
- **Node version warnings** – switch to Node 20 (`nvm use 20`, `fnm use 20`, etc.) to avoid runtime issues.

Enjoy building on the generative desktop! ✨
