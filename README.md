# Generative Computer

![Generative Computer in action](./generative-computer-demo.gif)

Generative Computer is an interactive desktop inspired by Claude Imagine and built on top of Gemini CLI. You can talk to the computer to generate any content you want.

This is a proof of concept which will be iterated quickly as the project develops.

## How It Works

A generative computer runs an AI agent on the backend that generates code to render what the user requests in real time.

1. You type a request in the computer (rendered in the browser).
2. The backend forwards the request to the Gemini agent.
3. Gemini edits `GeneratedContent.tsx` (and only that file right now).
4. Vite hot-reloads, so the desktop windows morph in real time.

## Gemini CLI Highlights

Upstream Gemini CLI powers this project; notable capabilities include:

- **🎯 Free tier**: 60 requests/min and 1,000 requests/day with personal Google account.
- **🧠 Powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Access to 1M token context window.
- **🔧 Built-in tools**: Google Search grounding, file operations, shell commands, web fetching.
- **🔌 Extensible**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for custom integrations.
- **💻 Terminal-first**: Designed for developers who live in the command line.
- **🛡️ Open source**: Apache 2.0 licensed.

## System Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm 9+
- Gemini CLI credentials on the machine (OAuth login, API key, or Vertex AI)

## First-Time Setup

Clone and boot the desktop:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshbickett/generative-computer
cd generative-computer
./computer
```

The helper installs dependencies, builds the Gemini CLI bundle, checks authentication, and launches both backend and frontend. If cached credentials are missing, it guides you through login before continuing. Future runs are the same—just type `./computer` from the repo root.

Prefer a global command? Run `npm link` (or symlink `computer` somewhere on your `$PATH`) to start the Generative Computer from any directory with a plain `computer`.

## Run the Full Experience

```bash
./computer
```

The orchestrator will:

- Double-check Gemini authentication (and reopen `npm start` if credentials are missing)
- Install dependencies for the repo, backend, and frontend when `node_modules/` folders are absent
- Build the Gemini CLI bundle if `bundle/gemini.js` is missing
- Start the backend on `http://localhost:3001` with `USE_REAL_AGENT=true`
- Start the Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173`

Press `Ctrl+C` to shut everything down.

### Helpful Environment Flags

- `DEBUG_AGENT=true ./computer` — surface Gemini stdout/stderr and write transcripts to `logs/agent/`

└── logs/agent/                 # Populated when DEBUG_AGENT=true
```

The nested `./runtime/` folder keeps the frontend and backend agents grouped together so the top-level `./computer` launcher can keep its original name.

## Stay In The Loop

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing bundle** – run `npm run build` if `bundle/gemini.js` is absent before calling `./computer` (or `npm start`).
- **Authentication loop** – rerun `npm start` and choose “Login with Google” (or your preferred auth mode) to refresh credentials.
- **Ports 3001/5173 busy** – stop conflicting processes; `./computer` attempts to free both ports automatically.
- **Node version warnings** – switch to Node 20 (`nvm use 20`, `fnm use 20`, etc.) to avoid runtime issues.

Enjoy building on the generative desktop! ✨

```bash
cd new-project/
gemini
> Write me a Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

#### Analyze existing code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
cd gemini-cli
gemini
